  - Structured logging
  - Error handling and security headers

### Monitoring & Observability  
- **Prometheus** (`prometheus/prometheus.yml`)
  - Metrics collection and storage
  - Service discovery for Flask app
  - Web UI for metrics visualization
  - Alerting capabilities (configurable)

### Data Protection
- **Automated Backup System** (`backup/backup_script.py`)
  - Scheduled backups every 15 minutes
  - Metadata tracking and versioning
  - Automatic cleanup of old backups
  - Restore functionality
  - Configurable paths for Docker/local deployment

### Containerization
- **Docker** (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`)
  - Multi-stage build for optimization
  - Non-root user for security
  - Health checks integrated
  - Minimal attack surface
  - Development and production configurations

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/main.yml`)
  - Automated testing on commits
  - Security vulnerability scanning (Trivy)
  - Docker image building and testing
  - Configuration validation
  - Deployment simulation

## 🔒 Security Features

✅ **Container Security**
- Non-root user execution
- Minimal base images (Python slim)
- Multi-stage builds to reduce attack surface
- Security scanning with Trivy

✅ **Application Security**  
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure headers configuration
- Environment variable management
- Secrets management ready

✅ **Infrastructure Security**
- Principle of least privilege
- Network isolation with Docker Compose
- Configuration as code
- Audit trail through version control

## 📊 Validation & Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite (`test_infrastructure.py`)
- **30 automated tests** covering all components
- **100% pass rate** achieved
- JSON test reporting for CI/CD integration
- Validates endpoints, metrics, backups, configurations

### Manual Validation
- Flask application endpoints tested
